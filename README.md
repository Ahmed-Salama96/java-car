# java-car
Class project in Java course at Faculty of science, this is a small game in which you have three different pictures ( car, tank, road ) and your role is to move the car a long the way. if you touched the coming car you will lose and when you touch the tank picture your tank score will increase. Again this an alpha version, if you wanna update this you can put levels on it.
